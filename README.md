# Food Delivery App

This project is a food delivery application built using the MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) stack. It includes several key features to enhance the user experience and streamline the food ordering process. These features include a secure authentication system using JSON Web Tokens (JWT) and bcrypt for password hashing, seamless integration with Stripe for payment processing, and efficient file handling with Multer. The application lets users view detailed menus, place orders, and track delivery status. Additional functionalities include user profile management, order history tracking, and the ability to rate and review restaurants. The application also incorporates responsive design principles and utilizes CORS and dotenv for secure and flexible environment configuration.
